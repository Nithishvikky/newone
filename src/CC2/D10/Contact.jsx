    <div> 
     <p>Place the contact lens on the tip of your index finger so the edge of the lens is pointing up. Then hold your finger up directly in front of your eyes so you can look at the lens from the side.

     If your contact forms a perfect cup-shape with the edge perfectly upright, the lens is correctly oriented and is ready to be placed on your eye. If the edge has a noticeable outward bend (like a rimmed soup bowl), the contact is inside out.</p>
